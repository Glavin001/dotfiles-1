h3. Automatic installer

You can install this via the command line with `curl`

h4. via `curl`

@curl -L https://github.com/eduardolundgren/dotfiles/raw/master/install.sh | sh@

h3. Customization

If you want to override any of the default behavior, just add a new file (ending in @.zsh@) into the @custom/@ directory.
If you have many functions which go well together you can put them as a *.plugin.zsh file in the @/plugins/@ directory and then enable this plugin.

Not implemented yet.

h2. Contributors

This project wouldn't exist without all of our awesome users and contributors.
